Software Design Template

_Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?_  
•	The Gaming room was a gaming company who was looking for a development company who could take their game, Draw It or Lose It, and develop a universal program that could run on multiple platforms, in order to expand their user base.  
_What did you do particulary well in developing this documentation?_  
•	I did well in addressing the client's needs and presenting them with all the information they needed in order to make a decision on whether or not to use our company for the project, including laying out any difficulties that would need to be addressed and making recommendations in order to bring the project to fruition. I was concise in explanations and tried to avoid technical jargon where necessary, as there are instances where business executives may not know all the jargon.   
_What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?_  
•	This allowed me to organize my thoughts in a visual way, and this helped me to present solutions as well.   
_If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?_  
•	I would choose the recommendations portion, and do more research in order to find the best alternative solutions, including those I had presented. 
_How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?_  
•	By incorporating the use of login authentication to allow control of access to the game. The user's needs are the sole basis for designing a program. The user's needs must be kept in mind throughout the whole of the desing process, as they are either the customer or the entity the customer will sell the product to.   
_How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?_    
•	I approached designing software with the user needs in mind, and with the vision set forth by the client. In the future, it may be helpful to create a log of templates for design or patterns for design for similar situations, and these can also be helpful to present to the customer in a visual way.
